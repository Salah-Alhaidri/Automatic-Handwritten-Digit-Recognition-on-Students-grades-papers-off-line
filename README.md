Automatic Handwritten Digit Recognition  on Students' grades papers  off-line
</h2>
<h3>Graduation project submitted to the Department of Software Engineering to obtain a bachelor's degree in the Department of Software Engineering</h3>

<h1>Scope and Limitations</h1>
The scope of this project is to construct an off-line Handwritten Digit Recognition on students grades paper  system and compare the different classifiers and combination approaches. Grades standard paper  which consists of the following fields: (student name ,academic number, practical grades ,mid-level grades, final grades, total grade) This project focuses mostly on segmentation and recognition of the components in the five fields except the student name because each student has a unique academic number he distinguishes  him from   other  like this structur:
